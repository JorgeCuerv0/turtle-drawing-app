# Main1: Creates a Turtle object for a figure then closes the window when clicked
# Main2: Creates a Turtle object to draw multiple figures instead of one
# Comparison of Main1 and Main2:
# - Main1 creates a new Turtle object each time a shape is drawn.
# - However, since each new object requires initialization it uses up more resources.
# On the other hand Main2 uses the same Turtle object to draw multiple figures.
# - This is more efficient in terms of memory, 
# this function also provides better  user experience as the user can draw multiple figures without having to restart the program each time.

'''Function that takes in a turtle object and a side length and draws a square'''

    # A loop that runs four times to draw the four sides of the square
    for i in range(4):
        my_turtle.forward(side_length)

'''Function that takes in a turtle object and a side length and draws an equilateral triangle'''
def draw_triangle(my_turtle, side_length):
    # A loop that runs three times to draw the three sides of the triangle
    for i in range(3):
        my_turtle.forward(side_length)

'''Function that takes in a turtle object and a radius and draws a circle'''
def draw_circle(my_turtle, radius):
    # Calls the circle method of the turtle object to draw a circle

    # Stores initial side length in a variable
    side_length = initial_side_length

    turn_angle = 360 / num_sides
    # A loop that runs num_sides times to draw the polygon
