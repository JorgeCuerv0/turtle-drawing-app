# SMC CS 87 - Turtle Drawing Application

## Overview
This project is a Turtle Drawing Application developed as part of SMC CS 87 coursework. The application allows users to choose and draw various geometric shapes using the Python Turtle graphics library. There are two main approaches implemented:

1. **Main** - Creates a new Turtle object for each shape drawn, closing the drawing environment after each figure.
2. **Main2** - Uses a single Turtle object to draw multiple shapes within a single drawing session, making the application more efficient in terms of resource use.

## Features
- Draw various shapes including squares, triangles, circles, spirals, and polygons.
- User-friendly input prompts to customize shape parameters like side length, radius, number of sides, etc.
- Two approaches:
  - **Main:** Ideal for isolated drawing sessions.
  - **Main2:** Optimized for drawing multiple shapes without restarting the application.

## Getting Started
